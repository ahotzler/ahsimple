# ahsimple
ahsimple - the simple Joomla! template was created as a programming exercise. The simple Joomla! template enables a quick start on the Internet, as the layout is largely predefined. Colors, images, logos and content can of course be adapted.

Documentation: https://www.andrehotzler.de/en/projects/ahsimple-the-simple-joomla-template.html (This website was created using this template.)

The template is free of charge. You can find more demos here: https://www.sofort-start-webseite.de/ (This is my commercial site where you can purchase the implementation of a website using this template.)
