# ahsimple
ahsimple - the simple Joomla! template was created as a programming exercise. The simple Joomla! template enables a quick start on the Internet, as the layout is largely predefined. Colors, images, logos and content can of course be adapted.

The template is also available as a service including installation and setup.
