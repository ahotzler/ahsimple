# ahsimple
ahsimple - the simple Joomla! template was created as a programming exercise.

The simple Joomla! template enables a quick start on the Internet, as the layout is largely predefined. Colors, images, logos and content can of course be adapted.

It uses Joomla! standard technologies and works without extensions and CCKs. This makes it easy to maintain and, above all, easy to update.

Since it does not use external data sources, it is GDPR-compliant.

At the moment, the functions most frequently used by users and shown in the demo have been implemented, but it will be expanded over time.
