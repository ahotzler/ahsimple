# ahsimple - simple joomla! template
ahsimple - the simple Joomla! template was created as a programming exercise.

The clean and simple Joomla! template enables a quick and efficient start on the Internet, as the layout is largely predefined.\
Colors, images, logos, and content can be easily customized to suit individual needs. It works entirely without third-party elements such as page builders, relying instead on Joomla!'s native features to ensure a streamlined and stable user experience.\
The template is built with clean, lightweight code optimized for fast loading times and maximum performance. It fully supports the Joomla! update system, for long-term compatibility and ease of maintenance.

The layout remains consistent across desktop and mobile devices, which significantly accelerates the initial setup - there‚Äôs no need to manage or adapt separate views.

Furthermore, the template does not load any external resources such as third-party fonts; all assets remain local. This avoids unintended data transfers to external servers and helps minimize potential privacy concerns under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Please note that this privacy-friendly setup applies solely to the template itself - any additional extensions or custom implementations must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not introduce external data sources).
